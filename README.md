# Tam's Mora Jai Box simulator
a shitty dinky itty bitty simulator for the mora jai puzzle boxes from Blue Prince, made with PyGame and meant to be used in a CLI.
simply run the mjbox shell script and it will teach you the rest.

# level creation
levels are stored in .jai files (which are normal text files that don't realy need a special extension, but i think its cool and gives context, so its now a requirement).
you type in a 3x3 grid of letters which correspond to certain colors, then right after that you specify the win condition by typing in a 2x2 grid of letters (colors that must be in the corners), and thats it. because im lazy anything after the 2x2 grid just doesn't matter at all and won't break the game.

## color symbols
gray: X
black: L
yellow: Y
violet: V
green: G
pink: P
red: R
orange: O
white: W
blue: B
